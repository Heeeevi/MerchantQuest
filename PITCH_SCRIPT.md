## 🎬 SCRIPT (REVISED WITH VERIFIED DATA)

### [0:00-0:30] HOOK - The Problem

**[VISUAL: News headlines about failed Web3 games, empty game lobbies, angry Twitter posts]**

> "The Web3 gaming industry has a fundamental problem.
> 
> Despite billions invested in blockchain games, the industry — in the words of a gaming veteran who created Xbox Live Arcade — 'still hasn't found a killer app.'
> 
> Why? Because the industry got it completely backwards.
> 
> They built speculation platforms and called them games."

### [0:30-1:30] THE PROBLEM - Deep Dive

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison - Traditional game fun moments vs Web3 game wallet popups and charts]**

> "Let me share what Greg Canessa, the former GM who created Xbox Live Arcade and now COO of Sequence, said about Web3 gaming:
> 
> *'The player perception right now is negative. The lack of innovation in terms of application of this technology in novel and interesting ways to make fun games is part of the reason.'*
> 
> He continues: *'People latched onto NFTs, but without interesting utility, people are just speculating — which brings in degenerate behavior.'*
> 
> **[PAUSE FOR EFFECT]**
> 
> Think about it. There are 3.6 billion gamers worldwide spending nearly 200 billion dollars annually on games. That's according to Newzoo's 2025 Global Games Market Report.
> 
> Yet Web3 gaming hasn't captured this massive audience. Why?
> 
> Because when a traditional gamer tries a blockchain game, within 5 minutes they're setting up wallets, buying tokens, approving transactions, watching gas fees... and they haven't even started playing yet.
> 
> The problem isn't blockchain technology. The problem is that Web3 games forgot their primary job: to be FUN first."x

### [1:30-2:30] THE SOLUTION - Introducing MerchantQuest

**[VISUAL: MerchantQuest gameplay - beautiful medieval map, merchant character, trading animations]**

> "This is MerchantQuest.
> 
> We didn't build another DeFi dashboard disguised as a game. We built a genuine adventure where blockchain enhances the experience, not replaces it.
> 
> You play as a medieval merchant, traveling between four unique cities - Silverport, Goldmere, Ironhold, and Silkwind. Each city has its own economy, its own prices, and its own opportunities.
> 
> **[SHOW GAMEPLAY: Buying silk cheap in Silkwind, selling it for profit in Goldmere]**
> 
> Buy low, sell high. Simple to understand. Deep to master.
> 
> But here's where it gets interesting...
> 
> Every merchant is an NFT with real progression. Your character levels up, unlocks achievements, and builds a trading reputation that's permanently recorded on Mantle Network.
> 
> The prices? They're not random numbers. They're powered by Pyth Network oracles, reflecting real-world commodity trends. Gold, wheat, iron, silk, spices - all influenced by actual market dynamics.
> 
> **This is blockchain serving gameplay, not gameplay serving blockchain.**"

### [2:30-3:30] KEY FEATURES & DIFFERENTIATION

**[VISUAL: Feature showcase with animated icons]**

> "Let me show you what makes MerchantQuest different.
> 
> **One: Fun-First Design**
> You can start playing in 30 seconds. No complex tokenomics tutorial. No mandatory token purchases. Just connect your wallet and begin your merchant journey.
> 
> **Two: Real Economic Strategy**  
> Our Pyth Oracle integration means prices respond to real-world events. When gold prices surge globally, it affects your in-game trading strategy. This creates emergent gameplay that's never the same twice.
> 
> **Three: Sustainable Economy**
> We've built multiple gold sinks - travel costs, ship repairs, marketplace fees - that prevent hyperinflation and keep the economy healthy long-term. This isn't a pump-and-dump. It's a sustainable game world.
> 
> **Four: Achievement System**
> Complete your first trade, visit all cities, become a profit master - every milestone is recorded on-chain. Your achievements are truly yours, forever.
> 
> **Five: Built on Mantle**
> Low gas fees, fast transactions, EVM-compatible. Players don't need to think about the blockchain. They just play."

### [4:15-4:45] THE ASK

**[VISUAL: Team photo, contact information]**

> "The Web3 gaming industry doesn't need another speculation tool.
>

> 
> MerchantQuest is that proof.

> We're looking for:
> - Strategic partners who believe in fun-first Web3 gaming
> - Early community members who want to shape the game's future
> - Feedback from judges who can help us refine our vision
> 
> The 3.6 billion gamers out there? They're not opposed to blockchain. They're waiting for a blockchain game worth playing."
